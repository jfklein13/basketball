# Basketball

This project is both a simple basketball simulator and a building block for adding both your own simulations, statistics and user interfaces. It is both meant as a toy for enjoying the back-and-forth of a basketball game and a starting point for developing your own basketball simulation ideas. You can even use this project to track a live basketball game, by plugging in a controller where you enter the results of each possession.

To get started, I recommend you use the [literate programming notebook](https://www.wolframcloud.com/env/jfklein/Published/BasketballSim.nb). To view the notebook without logging in, use its [object view](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/jfklein/Published/BasketballSim.nb).

This notebook is set to AutoCopy, so you'll get a strip across the top to create your own copy of the source so you can edit it. You will need a Wolfram Cloud account.
